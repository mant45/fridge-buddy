## About.
A project by Mantas(@mant45) & Kenneth (@kennethgargan)

Upon completion of our AWS re/start programme, we decided to work on a project that put into use what we learnt but also expanded our knowledge of Cloud services. 

We wanted to make a project that included all areas of a web app. Including developing the front end, provisioning services to developing the back-end. 


## Technologies.
### Languages: 
- Python 3.10.
- JavaScript.

### Back-End Technologies:
- [AWS API Gateway.](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
- [AWS Lambda.](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [AWS DynamoDB.](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

### Libaries Used:
- [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) - AWS SDK for Python used to manage our DynamoDB service.

### Infrastructure Management:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - Allowed us to predictably create, change, and improve our infrastructure.
