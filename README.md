## About.
A project by Mantas(@mant45) & Kenneth (@kennethgargan)

Upon completion of our AWS re/start programme, we decided to work on a project that put into use what we learnt but also expanded our knowledge of Cloud services. 

We wanted to make a project that included all areas of a web app. Including developing the front end, provisioning services to developing the back-end. 


## Technologies.
### Front-End
Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Services: GitHub Pages

### Back-End
Development: Python
Services: API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB
Infrastructure Management: Terraform

## How It Works.
